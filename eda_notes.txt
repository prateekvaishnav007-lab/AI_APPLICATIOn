EDA Interpretation Notes
=======================

1. Summary Statistics:
   - The dataset contains 44,019 rows and 10 columns (after cleaning).
   - All features are real-valued and on different scales.
   - No missing values are present in the cleaned data.

2. Feature Distributions:
   - Most features show a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of outliers or a long tail.
   - Some features (e.g., F3, F4) are fractional and bounded between 0 and 1.
   - The target variable (RMSD) is continuous and also right-skewed, with most values concentrated at the lower end.

3. Correlation Heatmap:
   - Several features are moderately to highly correlated (e.g., F1, F2, F5).
   - High correlation between features may indicate redundancy and the need for dimensionality reduction or feature selection.
   - RMSD shows moderate correlation with F1, F2, and F5, suggesting these features are important predictors.

4. RMSD Distribution:
   - The RMSD values are mostly low, with a few high outliers.
   - Predicting high RMSD values may be more challenging due to their rarity.

5. Recommendations:
   - Consider scaling features before modeling due to different value ranges.
   - Investigate highly correlated features for possible removal or transformation.
   - Outlier handling may improve model robustness.
